/**
  * # __Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...__
  *
  * They found out you're a programmer and asked you to
  * solve something they've been wondering for a long time.
  *
  * Write a function that, given:
  *
  *   1. an `amount` of money
  *   2. a list of coin `denominations`
  *
  * computes the number of ways to make the amount of money
  * with coins of the available `denominations`.
  *
  * __Example__: for `amount` = 4 (4 cents) and
  * denominations = [1, 2, 3] (1 cent, 2 cent, 3 cent),
  * your program would output 4 -- the number of ways to make
  * 4 cents with those `denominations`:
  *
  *   1. 1 cent, 1 cent, 1 cent, 1 cent
  *   2. 1 cent, 1 cent, 2 cent
  *   3. 1 cent, 3 cent
  *   4. 2 cent, 2 cent
  *
